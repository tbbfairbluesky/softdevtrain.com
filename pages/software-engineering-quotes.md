* Elegance always pays off. In the short term it might seem like it takes much longer to come up
  with a truly graceful solution to a problem, but when it works the first time and easily adapts
  to new situations instead of requiring hours, days, or months of struggle, you'll see the rewards
  (even if no one can measure them). And there's nothing that matches the feeling that comes from
  knowing you've got an amazing design. *Resist the urge to hurry; it will only slow you down.*
  -- Eckel, Bruce. 1998. *Thinking in Java.* Prentice Hall PTR, Upper Saddle River, NJ. p 1056.

* Casting the solution in the same terms as the problem is tremendously beneficial because you
  don't need a lot of intermediate models to get from a description of the problem to a
  description of the solution. With objects, the type hierarchy is the primary model, so you go
  directly from the description of the system in the real world to the description of the system
  in code. Indeed, one of the difficulties people have with object-oriented design is that it's
  too simple to get from the beginning to the end. A mind trained to look for complex solutions
  is often stumped by this simplicity at first. -- Eckel, Bruce. 2000. *Thinking in C++.* 2nd Edition.

* Donald Knuth observed that: premature optimization is the root of all evil.
  -- Stroustrup, Bjarne. *The C++ Programming Language.* Third Edition. p. 713.

* Provided it makes some minimum of sense, most people do what they are encouraged to do. In particular,
  if in the context of a software project you reward certain ways of operating and penalize others,
  only exceptional programmers and designers will risk their careers to do what they consider right
  in the face of management opposition, indifference, and red tape.

  In Short: An organization that treats its programmers as morons will soon have programmers that
  are willing and able to act like morons only.
  -- Stroustrup, Bjarne. *The C++ Programming Language.* Third Edition, p. 713.

* The Roman Rule: The one who says it cannot be done should never interrupt the one who is doing it.
  -- Unknown.
